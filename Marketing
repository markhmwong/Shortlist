# Article notes
Slimming down
Why should we reduce our tasks
balance your life
feel accomplished everyday with no left over tasks

# What is Shortlist?

A systemised todo list application at it's core by enforcing limits on what we allow ourselves to achieve because the typical day only has 23 hours 59mins 59 seconds.

# Why make Shortlist?

This was tough to make, as the market for to do lists is muchly oversaturated but here we are with perhaps a todo list that hopefully goes against the trend to being an all in one application because it's not that. I feel that most to-do lists lose their focus and try to be everything in one, with no particular system in place to guide your tasks - with virtually unlimited storage to add tasks, unlimited prioritised tasks, no review, and little collective data.

# What are the differences between Shortlist and something like the Apple Reminders App and Todoist

As mentioned above most to do list applications tend to be an all in one solution with no guidance. The stand out features are listed below

- Personalise your task limitation per day.
- Carry over incomplete tasks from yesterday while maintaining the limit.
- Limited on the number of high/medium/low priority tasks you may add
- Review yesterday's tasks on a new day
- A stats system to view your behavior and progress over time
- Prepare tomorrow's tasks

# Is my data stored on a 3rd party server?

All data is stored locally on the device.


By eliminating the limitless feature of our devices that we all take for granted, we are less likely to pour information into our devices willy nilly (without direction).

- Personalise your task limitation per day.
- Carry over incomplete tasks from yesterday
- Organise task and flag one task as a must do
- Review yesterday's tasks on a new day
- Prepare tomorrow's tasks
- does not allow for new tasks after Xpm (lock the add button). Because people have different schedules and may work night shifts
- stats
- a system
