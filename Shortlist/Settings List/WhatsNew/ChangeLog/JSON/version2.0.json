I've been away for some time as I've found a new job and it's time consuming and although most of my day is spent at said job, I do try to do what I can even if a little on this app. I still believe in this app and the purpose it provides, as it isn't something that is aimed at short term gain rather a long term gain in mental and physical health. I hope you find it useful to keep your life better balanced. Stay safe.",
